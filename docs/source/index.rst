Welcome to DoseCalcs's documentation!
=====================================

The DoseCalcs application is built for Linux, and is based on Geant4 toolkit, that is a set of physics libraries coded in C++ which serve to solve physics problems concerning the transport of radiation in matter using the Monte Carlo method. The application implements these functionalities to simulate the internal dosimetry problem. It allows the study of interaction of radiation emitted from a region source with the matter filling all other body regions in order to score the related internal dosimetry quantities. Thus, DoseCalcs can be used for advanced research and as an educational tool in radiation protection field.
